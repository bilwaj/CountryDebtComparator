# CountryDebtComparator
This is a project that should allow users to compare macro-economic indicators any two nations.
This project currently uses preloaded data. However, I will be adding automated data scraping as we go along.

Currently it allows for comparing Debt/GDP between a limited set of nations. This will be extended with time.
